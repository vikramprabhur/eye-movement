# Responsive Eye Movement - "Big Brother is Wacthing You"

## Description:
  - This is an accolade to George Orwell's 1984.
  - The title of the page is one of the most famous lines from the book.
  - The quote underneath is the first line of the book, which became very famous.
  - When the user clicks on the start button at the bottom right corner, the eyes become responsive, and follow the movement of the mouse across the page.

## Launch Page:

  - [(https://vikramprabhur.github.io/eye-movement/Index.html)] 

## Future Improvements:
  - My next iteration would include a feature that would automatically change the color of the Iris "the ball in the eyes" upon contact with the different sections of the eyes.
  - I would then create a version that would allow the user to generate the eyes on command, by clicking on a button.
  - The next iteration would include an option, which would allow the user to select a "automatic scan" that would move the Iris from side to side, automatically and in a realistic manner, to mimic a person scanning the room.
